## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- A `CarrierException` no longer carries the app key and secret, the access token and the signature
  (in the query). The message quoted the HTTP client's (the whole URL), the previous was the
  client's own exception, and every trace of the chain kept the arguments of the calls under it (the
  request's options, the `Api` with its credentials) when `zend.exception_ignore_args` is off: a log
  of the whole chain wrote them. The message masks them as `***`, the previous is a copy of the
  client's exception (the same class and code), and no exception `Api` throws keeps its trace's
  arguments (`Omnibus\Http\Redaction`).
- The signature's timestamp is Beijing time (GMT+8), as JD's open platform reads it, whatever PHP's
  default time zone; it was PHP's default time zone.
